# Connected Sub-Graphs Homework

This repository contains two Python files, CB_2_1 and CB_2_2, which address the connected sub-graphs homework questions. These programs are written in Python and can be run independently to perform different tasks related to sub-graph analysis.

## Prerequisites

To run the Python files, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.x versions. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## File Descriptions

- CB_2_1.py: This file generates all connected sub-graphs of a given size n and outputs the results to a textual file. It takes a positive integer n as input and generates all possible sub-graphs of size n.

- CB_2_2.py: This file analyzes a given graph and identifies sub-graphs of a specified size n. It counts the number of instances for each motif and outputs the results to a textual file.

## Running the Programs

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python files are located.

3. To run CB_2_1.py, use the following command:

'''
python CB_2_1.py
'''

Follow the prompts to enter a positive integer n. The program will generate all connected sub-graphs of size n and save the results to a file.

4. To run CB_2_2.py, use the following command:
'''
python CB_2_2.py
'''


Follow the prompts to enter a positive integer n and provide a graph in the specified format. The program will identify sub-graphs of size n and count the number of instances for each motif, saving the results to a file.

## Sample Outputs

In the repository, you can find sample output files for each program, showcasing the results for different values of n. These files can be used as a reference to understand the expected format of the output.

## Maximal Computation Time

The maximal number n for which the programs can complete successfully within different time limits may vary depending on your system's computational capabilities. As the complexity of the computations increases with larger values of n, the execution time may also increase.

For question 1:

- The maximal number n that can be completed within 1 hour of computing time may depend on your system's speed and resources.

- Similarly, the maximal number n that can be completed within 2, 4, or 8 hours of computing time will vary.

For question 2:

- The computation time will depend on the size and complexity of the input graph. The maximal number n that can be completed within the given time limits may vary.

Please note that these time limits are approximate and can vary based on the efficiency of your system and the complexity of the computations.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it as needed, and provide your own input graphs to test the programs.
